# Style Guide

This is my (Todd Eddy / vrillusions) personal list of guidelines I follow. It's mostly here for my own reference since some things I tend to forget. Even simple things like versioning and if the tag name is 'v1.0.0' or just '1.0.0'.

- [coding](coding.mkd) - General coding guidelines
- [git](git.mkd) - Git
- Language Specifics
    - bash - Bash (tbd)
    - [python](python.mkd) - Python
