# Style Guide

This is a list of guidelines I follow. It's primarily here for my own reference since some items I tend to forget. Even simple items like versioning and if the tag name is 'v1.0.0' or '1.0.0'. While this is all information I've kept in mind, most of the code I've written since late 2013 didn't put an emphasis on it. As needed I'll go through and clean up older projects.
